# Personality_Detection
This is a small project on Personality Detection. The dataset
used in this project is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Dataset
which can be found at the given link 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type

My thoughts on the project are as follows
1. Create a model that is able to analyze the person's
personality through a text
2. Wrap the model in a wrapper and use django to create a web app
